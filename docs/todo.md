- display the time summary like <current time> -> 5 tasks -> <estimated time at completion of all tasks>
I think this is good for visualization.

Also, I think that current task playing should be on user, or associated with user, and synced by device. So that if you have multiple, you see up to date time counting down.
This might be tricky - the playing part - but at least, I think that the live counting would be cool, and prevent confusion of which device is counting down you know?
