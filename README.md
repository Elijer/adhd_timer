# Drag n Drop
I just want to implement drag and drop for a list. This seems like a good thing to be able to do.

## Out of box solutions

## hello-pangea/dnd
Umm this is very impressive, philosophically sound (to a degree I didn't know was necessary) and its credibility is good, as it seems that it was originally developed by Atlassian, aka the creators of Trello, AKA the original Kanban (in my mind anyways).

[Hmm looks like they have a storybook](https://dnd.hellopangea.com/?path=/docs/welcome--docs).

[And they have really thought this out](https://medium.com/@alexandereardon/rethinking-drag-and-drop-d9f5770b4e6b)

So I mean, it would be worth considering other solutions and making sure that this is still maintained, but it looks like a good fit.

Things I've been learning
- I'm kind of bad at managing my time
- By jumping to the first existing solutions of repurposing other people's code, it's very easy for me to actually waste a LOT of time with overly complex implementations of deprecated tools ðŸ˜¬
